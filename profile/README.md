# Welcome to the Interis 64 project

## What is it?

Interis 64 is a build-it-yourself homebrew computer design.

Here are some basic specs:

- Zilog Z80 CPU at 7.4MHz
- 32KB System ROM
- 64KB SRAM
- PS/2 Keyboard Support
- RS-232 Serial Port
- Battery-backed SRAM and Realtime Clock
- Four expansion card slots



## What makes it different?

Interis 64 doesn't make any specific attempts at being different, especially not simply for the sake of being different. I think the main differentiator is the expansion slots, which are designed to make expansion cards easy to design and easy to use.



## Why did you bother?

There are plenty of other similar projects (and products) out there. This really started as purely a learning experience for me and grew like crazy until it got here. I'm proud of what I've built and hopefully it can serve as a way for others to learn as well.



## How do I get one?

It must be noted that this is a *project* and not a *product*. That means I do not plan to sell boards, components, software, services, or support. You're essentially on your own for those things. Source files for all hardware and software are available and work with freely-available tools, so it should be accessible to anyone.

I tried to use generally-available components whenever possible, but some vintage parts were necessary and are getting more difficult to find.
